# Interactive Etch Demo and Prototyping Tool

Easily spin-up a browser-based app locally to deploy and interact with your Etch contract using Python Flask. This allow for rapid prototyping and QA testing through a UI/UX. This is loosely based off of [Ethereum Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) IDE.

### Steps for Launching the App

1) Spin-up a local Fetch ledger. See Fetch's Getting Started doc [here](https://docs.fetch.ai/getting-started/quickstart/).
2) Install the following packages:
```
pip install flask
pip install fetchai-ledger-api
```
3) Run `git clone` this repo to your local directory
4) Run `cd etch-demos/app/`
5) Run `python start.py` to start the app on the localhost. You should see the following message on your console:
```
 * Serving Flask app "start" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
```
6) Copy-paste this link `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` into the browser of your choice.
7) Click on `Info` for more details about how to use this app.


### Sample Etch Contracts

This repo comes with three sample Etch contracts that you can use to experiment with the app. More samples will be added as more functionalities are added in the Etch language.

1) **Hello World** dApp. See contract at [hello.etch](https://github.com/fetchai/etch-demos/blob/master/demos/hello-world/hello.etch).
2) **Pet Shop** dApp based from the Truffle [tutorial](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/pet-shop). See contract at [adoption.etch](https://github.com/fetchai/etch-demos/blob/master/demos/pet-shop/adoption.etch).
3) **Simple Open Auction** dApp based from the Ethereum Vyper [tutorial](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.13/vyper-by-example.html#simple-open-auction). See contract at [auction.etch](https://github.com/fetchai/etch-demos/blob/master/demos/simple-open-auction/auction.etch).


### Full Walkthrough Guide

For an end-to-end walkthrough from how create your Etch contract to how to deploy and interact with it on-chain with the Python [SDK](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-api-py), go to the following Jupyter Notebook [guide](https://github.com/fetchai/etch-demos/blob/master/demos/guide.ipynb). This is basically how the this prototyping app executes under-the-hood.
